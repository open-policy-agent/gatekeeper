title: How to use Gatekeeper
---

Gatekeeper uses the [OPA Constraint Framework](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/frameworks/tree/master/constraint) to describe and enforce policy. Look there for more detailed information on their semantics and advanced usage.

## Constraint Templates

Before you can define a constraint, you must first define a `ConstraintTemplate`, which describes both the [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego) that enforces the constraint and the schema of the constraint. The schema of the constraint allows an admin to fine-tune the behavior of a constraint, much like arguments to a function.

Here is an example constraint template that requires all labels described by the constraint to be present:

```yaml
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: ConstraintTemplate
metadata:
  name: k8srequiredlabels
spec:
  crd:
    spec:
      names:
        kind: K8sRequiredLabels
      validation:
        # Schema for the `parameters` field
        openAPIV3Schema:
          properties:
            labels:
              type: array
              items: string
  targets:
    - target: admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh
      rego: |
        package k8srequiredlabels

        violation[{"msg": msg, "details": {"missing_labels": missing}}] {
          provided := {label | input.review.object.metadata.labels[label]}
          required := {label | label := input.parameters.labels[_]}
          missing := required - provided
          count(missing) > 0
          msg := sprintf("you must provide labels: %v", [missing])
        }
```

You can install this ConstraintTemplate with the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/demo/basic/templates/k8srequiredlabels_template.yaml
```

## Constraints

Constraints are then used to inform Gatekeeper that the admin wants a ConstraintTemplate to be enforced, and how. This constraint uses the `K8sRequiredLabels` constraint template above to make sure the `gatekeeper` label is defined on all namespaces:

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sRequiredLabels
metadata:
  name: ns-must-have-gk
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Namespace"]
  parameters:
    labels: ["gatekeeper"]
```

You can install this Constraint with the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/master/demo/basic/constraints/all_ns_must_have_gatekeeper.yaml
```

Note the `match` field, which defines the scope of objects to which a given constraint will be applied. It supports the following matchers:

   * `kinds` accepts a list of objects with `apiGroups` and `kinds` fields that list the groups/kinds of objects to which the constraint will apply. If multiple groups/kinds objects are specified, only one match is needed for the resource to be in scope.
   * `scope` accepts `*`, `Cluster`, or `Namespaced` which determines if cluster-scoped and/or namesapced-scoped resources are selected. (defaults to `*`)
   * `namespaces` is a list of namespace names. If defined, a constraint will only apply to resources in a listed namespace.
   * `excludedNamespaces` is a list of namespace names. If defined, a constraint will only apply to resources not in a listed namespace.
   * `labelSelector` is a standard Kubernetes label selector.
   * `namespaceSelector` is a standard Kubernetes namespace selector. If defined, make sure to add `Namespaces` to your `configs.config.gatekeeper.sh` object to ensure namespaces are synced into OPA. Refer to the [Replicating Data section](sync.md) for more details.

Note that if multiple matchers are specified, a resource must satisfy each top-level matcher (`kinds`, `namespaces`, etc.) to be in scope. Each top-level matcher has its own semantics for what qualifies as a match. An empty matcher is deemed to be inclusive (matches everything). Also understand `namespaces`, `excludedNamespaces`, and `namespaceSelector` will match on cluster scoped resources which are not namespaced. To avoid this adjust the `scope` to `Namespaced`.

## Observability

This section covers how to gather more detailed statistics about Gatekeeper's query performance. This can be helpful in diagnosing situations such as identifying a constraint template with a long execution time. Statistics are written to Gatekeeper's stdout logs.

### Logging Constraint Execution Stats

- set `--log-stats-audit`. This flag enables logging the stats for the audit process.

- set `--log-stats-admission`. This flag enables logging the stats for the admission review process.

#### Example Log Line

To see how long it takes to review a constraint kind at admission time, enable the `--log-stats-admission` flag and watch the logs for a constraint kind `K8sRequiredLabels`,  for example:

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "ts": 1683692576.9093642,
  "logger": "webhook",
  "msg": "admission review request stats",
  "hookType": "validation",
  "process": "admission",
  "event_type": "review_response_stats",
  "resource_group": "",
  "resource_api_version": "v1",
  "resource_kind": "Namespace",
  "resource_namespace": "",
  "request_username": "kubernetes-admin",
  "execution_stats": [
    {
      "scope": "template",
      "statsFor": "K8sRequiredLabels",
      "stats": [
        {
          "name": "templateRunTimeNS",
          "value": 762561,
          "source": {
            "type": "engine",
            "value": "Rego"
          },
          "description": "the number of nanoseconds it took to evaluate all constraints for a template"
        },
        {
          "name": "constraintCount",
          "value": 1,
          "source": {
            "type": "engine",
            "value": "Rego"
          },
          "description": "the number of constraints that were evaluated for the given constraint kind"
        }
      ],
      "labels": [
        {
          "name": "TracingEnabled",
          "value": false
        },
        {
          "name": "PrintEnabled",
          "value": false
        },
        {
          "name": "target",
          "value": "admission.k8s.gatekeeper.sh"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In the excerpt above, notice `templateRunTimeNS` and `constraintCount`. The former indicates the time it takes to evaluate the number of constraints of kind `K8sRequiredLabels`, while the latter surfaces how many such constraints were evaluated for this template. Labels provide additional information about the execution environemnt setup, like whether tracing was enabled (`TraceEnabled`).

#### Caveats

The additional log volume from enabling the stats logging can be quite high.

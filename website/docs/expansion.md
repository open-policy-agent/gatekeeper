title: Validation of Workload Resources
---

`Feature State:` Gatekeeper version v3.10+ (alpha)

> ❗This feature is in _alpha_ stage, and is not enabled by default. To
> enable, set the `enable-generator-resource-expansion` flag.

A workload resource is a resource that creates other resources, such as a
Deployment or Job. Gatekeeper can be configured to reject workload resources
that might create a resource that violates a constraint. For example, one could
configure Gatekeeper to immediately reject deployments that would create a Pod
that violates a constraint instead of merely rejecting the Pods. To achieve
this, Gatekeeper creates a "mock resource" for the Pod, runs validation on it,
and aggregates the mock resource's violations onto the parent resource (the
Deployment in this example).

To use this functionality, first specify which resources should be "expanded"
into mock resource(s) by creating an `ExpansionTemplate` custom resource. This
specifies the GVKs of the workload resources, the GVK of the resultant mock
resource, as well as which subfield of the workload resource should be used to
expand the mock resource (i.e. `spec.template` for most Pod-generating
resources).

In some cases, it may not be possible to build an accurate representation of a
mock resource by looking at the workload resource alone. For example, suppose a
cluster is using Istio, which will inject a sidecar container on specific
resources. This sidecar configuration is not specified in the config of the
workload resource (i.e. Deployment), but rather injected by Istio's webhook. In
order to accurately represent mock resources modified by controllers or
webhooks, Gatekeeper leverages its
[Mutations](mutation.md)
feature to allow mock resources to be manipulated into their desired form. In
the Istio example, `Assign` and `ModifySet` mutators could be configured to
mimic Istio sidecar injection. For further details on mutating mock resources
see the [Math Source](#match-source) section below, or to see a working example,
see the [Example](#example) section.

Any resources configured for expansion will be expanded by both the validating
webhook and
[Audit](audit.md). This
feature will only be enabled if a user creates a `ExpansionTemplate` that
targets some resource that exists on the cluster.

Note that the accuracy of enforcement depends on how well the mock resource
resembles the real thing. Mutations can help with this, but 100% accuracy is
impossible because not all fields can be predicted. For instance, deployments
create pods with random names. Inaccurate mocks may lead to over or under
enforcement. In the case of under enforcement, the resultant pod should still be
rejected. Finally, non-state-based policies (those that rely on transient
metadata such as requesting user or time of creation) cannot be enforced
accurately. This is because such metadata would necessarily be different when
creating the resultant resource. For example, a deployment is created using the
requesting user's account, but the pod creation request comes from the service
account of the deployment controller.

If, for any reason, you want to exempt expanded resources from a specific
constraint, look at the [Match Source](#match-source) section below.

## Configuring Expansion

Expansion behavior is configured through the `ExpansionTemplate` custom
resource. Optionally, users can create `Mutation` custom resources to customize
how resources are expanded. Mutators with the `source: Generated` field will
only be applied when expanding workload resources, and will not mutate real
resources on the cluster. If the `source` field is not set, the `Mutation` will
apply to both expanded resources and real resources on the cluster.

Users can test their expansion configuration using the
[`gator expand` CLI](gator.md)
.

#### ExpansionTemplate

The `ExpansionTemplate` custom resource specifies:

- Which resource(s) should be expanded, specified by their GVK
- The GVK of the resultant resource
- Which field to use as the "source" for the resultant resource. The template
  source is a field on the parent resource which will be used as the base for
  expanding it before any mutators are applied. For example, in a case where a
  `Deployment` expands into a `Pod`, `spec.template` would typically be the
  source.
- Optionally, an enforcement action override can be used when validating resultant
  resources. If this field is set, any violations against the resultant resource
  will use this enforcement action. If an enforcement action is not specified by
  the `ExpansionTemplate`, the enforcement action set by the Constraint in
  violation will be used.

Here is an example of a `ExpansionTemplate` that specifies that `DeamonSet`,
`Deployment`, `Job`, `ReplicaSet`, `ReplicationController`, and `StatefulSet`
should be expanded into a `Pod`.

```
apiVersion: expansion.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ExpansionTemplate
metadata:
  name: expand-deployments
spec:
  applyTo:
    - groups: ["apps"]
      kinds: ["DeamonSet", "Deployment", "Job", "ReplicaSet", "ReplicationController", "StatefulSet"]
      versions: ["v1"]
  templateSource: "spec.template"
  enforcementAction: "warn"
  generatedGVK:
    kind: "Pod"
    group: ""
    version: "v1"
```

With this `ExpansionTemplate`, any constraints that are configured to target
`Pods` will be evaluated on the "mock Pods" when a `Deployment` /`ReplicaSet` is
being reviewed. Any violations created against the mock Pod will have their
enforcement action set to `warn`, regardless of the enforcement actions
specified by the Constraint in violation.

#### Match Source

The `source` field on the `match` API, present in the Mutation
and `ConstraintTemplate` kinds, specifies if the config should match Generated (
i.e. expanded) resources, Original resources, or both. The `source` field is
an `enum` which accepts the following values:

- `Generated` – the config will only apply to expanded resources, **and will not
  apply to any real resources on the cluster**
- `Original` – the config will only apply to Original resources, and will not
  affect expanded resources
- `All` – the config will apply to both `Generated` and `Original` resources.
  This is the default value.

For example, suppose a cluster's `ReplicaSet` controller adds a default value
for `fooField` when creating Pods that cannot reasonably be added to the
`ReplicaSet`'s `spec.template`. If a constraint relies on these default values,
a user could create a Mutation custom resource that modifies expanded resources,
like so:

```
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1
kind: Assign
metadata:
  name: assign-foo-field
spec:
  applyTo:
  - groups: [""]
    kinds: ["Pod"]
    versions: ["v1"]
  location: "spec.containers[name: *].fooField"
  parameters:
    assign:
      value: "Bar"
  match:
    source: "Generated"
    scope: Cluster
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: []
        kinds: []
```

Similarly, `Constraints` can be configured to only target expanded resources by
setting the `Constraint`'s `spec.match.source` field to `Generated`. This can
also be used to define different enforcement actions for expanded resources and
original resources.

## Example

Suppose a cluster is using Istio, and has some policy configured to ensure
specified Pods have an Istio sidecar. To validate Deployments that would create
Pods which Istio will inject a sidecar into, we need to use mutators to mimic
the sidecar injection.

What follows is an example of:

- an  `ExpansionTemplate` configured to expand `Deployments` into `Pods`
- an `Assign` mutator to add the Istio sidecar container to `Pods`
- a `ModifySet` mutator to add the `proxy` and `sidecar` args
- an inbound `Deployment`, and the resulting `Pod`

**Note that the Mutators set the `source: Generated` field, which will cause
them to only be applied when expanding resources specified
by `ExpansionTemplates`. These Mutators will not affect any real resources on
the cluster.**

```
apiVersion: expansion.gatekeeper.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ExpansionTemplate
metadata:
  name: expand-deployments
spec:
  applyTo:
  - groups: [ "apps" ]
    kinds: [ "Deployment" ]

    kind: "Pod"
    group: ""
    version: "v1"

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:

  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:

        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        args:
        - "/bin/sh"
```

When expanded, the above configs will produce the following `Pod`:

```

  containers:
  - args:
    - /bin/sh

    - sidecar

      protocol: TCP

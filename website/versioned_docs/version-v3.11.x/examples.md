The [demo/basic](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/tree/master/demo/basic) directory contains the above examples of simple constraints, templates and configs to play with.

The [demo/agilebank](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/tree/master/demo/agilebank) directory contains more complex examples based on a slightly more realistic scenario. Both folders have a handy demo script to step you through the demos.

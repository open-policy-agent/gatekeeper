title: Mutation
---

The mutation feature allows Gatekeeper modify Kubernetes resources at request time based on customizable mutation policies.

> ðŸš§ This feature is in _beta_ stage and it is enabled by default.

## Mutation CRDs

Mutation policies are defined using mutation-specific CRDs, called __mutators__:
- AssignMetadata - defines changes to the metadata section of a resource
- Assign - any change outside the metadata section
- ModifySet - adds or removes entries from a list, such as the arguments to a container

The rules for mutating metadata are more strict than for mutating the rest of the resource. The differences are described in more detail below.

Here is an example of a simple AssignMetadata CRD:
```yaml
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: AssignMetadata
metadata:
  name: demo-annotation-owner
spec:
  match:
    scope: Namespaced
    kinds:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      kinds: ["Pod"]
  location: "metadata.annotations.owner"
  parameters:
    assign:
      value:  "admin"
```

Each mutation CRD can be divided into 3 distinct sections:
- extent of changes - what is to be modified (kinds, namespaces, ...)
- intent - the path and value of the modification
- conditional - conditions under which the mutation will be applied

#### Extent of changes

The extent of changes section describes which resources will be mutated.
It allows selecting resources to be mutated using the same match criteria
as constraints.

An example of the extent of changes section.
```yaml
applyTo:
- groups: [""]
  kinds: ["Pod"]
  versions: ["v1"]
match:
  scope: Namespaced | Cluster
  kinds:
  - apiGroups: []
    kinds: []
  labelSelector: []
  namespaces: []
  namespaceSelector: []
  excludedNamespaces: []
```

Note that the `applyTo` field is required for `Assign` and `ModifySet` mutators, and does not exist for `AssignMetadata` mutators.
`applyTo` allows Gatekeeper to understand the schema of the objects being modified, so that it can detect when two mutators disagree as
to a kind's schema, which can cause non-convergent mutations. Also, the `applyTo` section does not accept globs.

The `match` section is common to all mutators. It supports the following match criteria:
- scope - the scope (Namespaced | Cluster) of the mutated resource
- kinds - the resource kind, any of the elements listed
- labelSelector - filters resources by resource labels listed
- namespaces - list of allowed namespaces, only resources in listed namespaces will be mutated
- namespaceSelector - filters resources by namespace selector
- excludedNamespaces - list of excluded namespaces, resources in listed namespaces will not be mutated

Note that any empty/undefined match criteria are inclusive: they match any object.

#### Intent

This specifies what should be changed in the resource.

An example of the section is shown below:
```yaml
location: "spec.containers[name: foo].imagePullPolicy"
parameters:
  assign:
    value: "Always"
```

The `location` element specifies the path to be modified.
The `parameters.assign.value` element specifies the value to be set for the element specified in `location`. Note that the value can either be a simple string or a composite value.

An example of a composite value:
```yaml
location: "spec.containers[name: networking]"
parameters:
  assign:
    value:
      name: "networking"
      imagePullPolicy: Always

```

The `location` element can specify either a simple subelement or an element in a list.
For example the location `spec.containers[name:foo].imagePullPolicy` would be parsed as follows:
- ***spec**.containers[name: foo].imagePullPolicy* - the spec element
- *spec.**containers[name: foo]**.imagePullPolicy* - container subelement of spec. The container element is a list. Out of the list chosen, an element with the `name` element having the value `foo`.
 - *spec.containers[name: foo].**imagePullPolicy*** - in the element from the list chosen in the previous step the element `imagePullPolicy` is chosen

The yaml illustrating the above `location`:
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: foo
    imagePullPolicy:
```

Wildcards can be used for list element values: `spec.containers[name: *].imagePullPolicy`

##### Assigning values from metadata

*This section does not apply to ModifySet mutators*

Sometimes it's useful to assign a field's value from metadata. For instance, injecting a deployment's name into its pod template's labels
to use affinity/anti-affinity rules to [keep Pods from the same deployment on different nodes](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/feedback/discussions/15).

Assign and AssignMetadata can do this via the `fromMetadata` field. Here is an example:

```
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: AssignMetadata
metadata:
  name: demo-annotation-owner
spec:
  location: "metadata.labels.namespace"
  parameters:
    assign:
      fromMetadata:
        field: namespace
```

Valid values for `spec.parameters.assign.fromMetadata.field` are `namespace` and `name`. They will inject the namespace's name and the object's name, respectively.


##### Conditionals

The conditions for updating the resource.

Mutation has path tests, which make it so the resource will only be mutated if the specified path exists/does not exist.
This can be useful for things like setting a default value if a field is undeclared, or for avoiding creating a field
when a parent is missing, such as accidentally creating an empty sidecar named "foo" in the example below:

```yaml
parameters:
  pathTests:
  - subPath: "spec.containers[name: foo]"
    condition: MustExist
  - subPath: spec.containers[name: foo].securityContext.capabilities
    condition: MustNotExist
```


### AssignMetadata

AssignMetadata is a mutator that modifies the metadata section of a resource. Note that the metadata of a resource is a very sensitive piece of data,
and certain mutations could result in unintended consequences. An example of this could be changing the name or namespace of a resource.
The AssignMetadata changes have therefore been limited to only the labels and annotations. Furthermore, it is currently only allowed to add a label or annotation.
Pre-existing labels and annotations cannot be modified.

 An example of an AssignMetadata adding a label `owner` set to `admin`:
```yaml
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: AssignMetadata
metadata:
  name: demo-annotation-owner
spec:
  match:
    scope: Namespaced
  location: "metadata.labels.owner"
  parameters:
    assign:
      value: "admin"
```

### ModifySet

ModifySet is a mutator that allows for the adding and removal of items from a list as if that list were a set.
New values are appended to the end of a list.

For example, the following mutator removes an `--alsologtostderr` argument from all containers in a pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: ModifySet
metadata:
  name: remove-err-logging
spec:
  location: "spec.containers[name: *].args"
  parameters:
    operation: prune
    values:
      fromList:
        - --alsologtostderr
```

- `spec.parameters.values.fromList` holds the list of values that will be added or removed.
- `operation` can be `merge` to insert values into the list if missing, or `prune` to remove values from the list. `merge` is default.


## Examples

### Adding an annotation

```yaml
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: AssignMetadata
metadata:
  name: demo-annotation-owner
spec:
  match:
    scope: Namespaced
  location: "metadata.annotations.owner"
  parameters:
    assign:
      value: "admin"
```

### Setting security context of a specific container in a Pod in a namespace to be non-privileged

Set the security context of container named `foo` in a Pod in namespace `bar` to be non-privileged

```yaml
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: Assign
metadata:
  name: demo-privileged
spec:
  applyTo:
  - groups: [""]
    kinds: ["Pod"]
    versions: ["v1"]
  match:
    scope: Namespaced
    kinds:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      kinds: ["Pod"]
    namespaces: ["bar"]
  location: "spec.containers[name:foo].securityContext.privileged"
  parameters:
    assign:
      value: false
```

#### Setting imagePullPolicy of all containers to Always in all namespaces except namespace `system`

```yaml
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: Assign
metadata:
  name: demo-image-pull-policy
spec:
  applyTo:
  - groups: [""]
    kinds: ["Pod"]
    versions: ["v1"]
  match:
    scope: Namespaced
    kinds:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      kinds: ["Pod"]
    excludedNamespaces: ["system"]
  location: "spec.containers[name:*].imagePullPolicy"
  parameters:
    assign:
      value: Always
```

### Adding a `network` sidecar to a Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: Assign
metadata:
  name: demo-sidecar
spec:
  applyTo:
  - groups: [""]
    kinds: ["Pod"]
    versions: ["v1"]
  match:
    scope: Namespaced
    kinds:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      kinds: ["Pod"]
  location: "spec.containers[name:networking]"
  parameters:
    assign:
      value:
        name: "networking"
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        image: quay.io/foo/bar:latest
        command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep INF"]

```

### Adding dnsPolicy and dnsConfig to a Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: Assign
metadata:
  name: demo-dns-policy
spec:
  applyTo:
  - groups: [""]
    kinds: ["Pod"]
    versions: ["v1"]
  match:
    scope: Namespaced
    kinds:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      kinds: ["Pod"]
  location: "spec.dnsPolicy"
  parameters:
    assign:
      value: None
---
apiVersion: mutations.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: Assign
metadata:
  name: demo-dns-config
spec:
  applyTo:
  - groups: [""]
    kinds: ["Pod"]
    versions: ["v1"]
  match:
    scope: Namespaced
    kinds:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      kinds: ["Pod"]
  location: "spec.dnsConfig"
  parameters:
    assign:
      value:
        nameservers:
        - 1.2.3.4
```

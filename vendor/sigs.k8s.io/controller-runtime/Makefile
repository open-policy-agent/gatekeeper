##@ General

# The help will print out all targets with their descriptions organized bellow their categories. The categories are represented by `##@` and the target descriptions by `##`.
# The awk commands is responsible to read the entire set of makefiles included in this invocation, looking for lines of the file as xyz: ## something, and then pretty-format the target and help. Then, if there's a line with ##@ something, that gets pretty-printed as a category.
# More info over the usage of ANSI control characters for terminal formatting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_parameters

### Added
* Added the `Store` interface, introducing support for custom storage implementations.
* Added the `NewWithStore` function for explicitly initializing a graph with a `Store` instance.
* Added the `EdgeData` functional option that can be used with `AddEdge`, introducing support for arbitrary data.
* Added the `Data` field to `EdgeProperties` for retrieving data added using `EdgeData`.

### Changed
* Changed `Order` to additionally return an error instance (breaking change).
* Changed `Size` to additionally return an error instance (breaking change).

## [0.15.1] - 2023-01-18

### Changed
* Changed `ShortestPath` to return `ErrTargetNotReachable` if the target vertex is not reachable.

### Fixed
* Fixed `ShortestPath` to return correct results for large unweighted graphs.

## [0.15.0] - 2022-11-25

### Added
* Added the `ErrVertexAlreadyExists` error instance. Use `errors.Is` to check for this instance.
* Added the `ErrEdgeAlreadyExists` error instance. Use `errors.Is` to check for this instance.
* Added the `ErrEdgeCreatesCycle` error instance. Use `errors.Is` to check for this instance.

### Changed
* Changed `AddVertex` to return `ErrVertexAlreadyExists` if the vertex already exists.
* Changed `VertexWithProperties` to return `ErrVertexNotFound` if the vertex doesn't exist.
* Changed `AddEdge` to return `ErrVertexNotFound` if either vertex doesn't exist.
* Changed `AddEdge` to return `ErrEdgeAlreadyExists` if the edge already exists.
* Changed `AddEdge` to return `ErrEdgeCreatesCycle` if cycle prevention is active and the edge would create a cycle.
* Changed `Edge` to return `ErrEdgeNotFound` if the edge doesn't exist.
* Changed `RemoveEdge` to return the error instances returned by `Edge`.

## [0.14.0] - 2022-11-01

### Added
* Added the `ErrVertexNotFound` error instance.

### Changed
* Changed `TopologicalSort` to fail at runtime when a cycle is detected.
* Changed `TransitiveReduction` to return the transitive reduction as a new graph and fail at runtime when a cycle is detected.
* Changed `Vertex` to return `ErrVertexNotFound` if the desired vertex couldn't be found.

## [0.13.0] - 2022-10-15

### Added
* Added the `VertexProperties` type for storing vertex-related properties.
* Added the `VertexWithProperties` method for retrieving a vertex and its properties.
* Added the `VertexWeight` functional option that can be used for `AddVertex`.
* Added the `VertexAttribute` functional option that can be used for `AddVertex`.
* Added support for rendering vertices with attributes using `draw.DOT`.

### Changed
* Changed `AddVertex` to accept functional options.
* Renamed `PermitCycles` to `PreventCycles`. This seems to be the price to pay if English isn't a library author's native language.

### Fixed
* Fixed the behavior of `ShortestPath` when the target vertex is not reachable from one of the visited vertices.

## [0.12.0] - 2022-09-19

### Added
* Added the `PermitCycles` option to explicitly prevent the creation of cycles.

### Changed
* Changed the `Acyclic` option to not implicitly impose cycle checks for operations like `AddEdge`. To prevent the creation of cycles, use `PermitCycles`.
* Changed `TopologicalSort` to only work for graphs created with `PermitCycles`. This is temporary.
* Changed `TransitiveReduction` to only work for graphs created with `PermitCycles`. This is temporary.

## [0.11.0] - 2022-09-15

### Added
* Added the `Order` method for retrieving the number of vertices in the graph.
* Added the `Size` method for retrieving the number of edges in the graph.

### Changed
* Changed the `graph` logo.
* Changed an internal operation of `ShortestPath` from O(n) to O(log(n)) by implementing the priority queue as a binary heap. Note that the actual complexity might still be defined by `ShortestPath` itself.

### Fixed
* Fixed `draw.DOT` to work correctly with vertices that contain special characters and whitespaces.

## [0.10.0] - 2022-09-09

### Added
* Added the `PredecessorMap` method for obtaining a map with all predecessors of each vertex.
* Added the `RemoveEdge` method for removing the edge between two vertices.
* Added the `Clone` method for retrieving a deep copy of the graph.
* Added the `TopologicalSort` function for obtaining the topological order of the vertices in the graph.
* Added the `TransitiveReduction` function for transforming the graph into its transitive reduction.

### Changed
* Changed the `visit` function of `DFS` to accept a vertex hash instead of the vertex value (i.e. `K` instead of `T`).
* Changed the `visit` function of `BFS` to accept a vertex hash instead of the vertex value (i.e. `K` instead of `T`).

### Removed
* Removed the `Predecessors` function. Use `PredecessorMap` instead and look up the respective vertex.

* Added the `Graph.Vertex` method for retrieving a vertex by its hash. This is not to be confused with the old `Graph.Vertex` function for adding vertices that got replaced with `Graph.AddVertex`.
* Added the `Graph.Edge` method for retrieving an edge. This is not to be confused with the old `Graph.Edge` function for creating an edge that got replaced with `Graph.AddEdge`.

* Removed the `Graph.Degree` method.
* Removed the `Graph.DFS` and `Graph.DFSByHash` methods. Use `DFS` instead.

### Changed
* Changed `Edge` to accept a variadic `options` parameter.

### Removed
* Removed the `WeightedEdge` function. Use `Edge` with the `EdgeWeight` functional option instead.
* Removed the `WeightedEdgeByHashes` function. Use `EdgeByHashes` with the `EdgeWeight` functional option instead.

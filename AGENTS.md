**Critical Configuration Files:**
- **`.golangci.yaml`** - Linting configuration, specifies exact rules and versions
- **`Makefile`** - Primary build system, all development commands defined here
- **`go.mod`** - Go modules with specific version pinning for stability
- **`main.go`** - Application entry point with webhook and controller setup

**Key Integration Points:**
- **OPA Frameworks:** `pkg/controller/constrainttemplate/` integrates constraint evaluation
- **cert-controller:** `main.go` sets up automatic TLS certificate rotation
- **Webhook Logic:** `pkg/webhook/admission/` handles policy evaluation during admission

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- **Unit Tests:** `*_test.go` files use testify/suite with envtest for Kubernetes APIs
- **E2E Tests:** `test/bats/test.bats` with full cluster scenarios using kind
- **Integration:** `pkg/controller/` tests use controller-runtime's envtest framework

### Build & Development Workflow

**Critical Prerequisites:**
- **Always install Go 1.24.2 or later** - verified compatible version
- **Docker with buildx support** - required for all builds
- **vendor/ directory must be present** - run `go mod vendor` if missing

**Essential Build Commands:**
```bash
# Complete build, lint, and test (primary development target)
make all                    # ~3-5 minutes, includes lint + test + manager

# Individual components
make manager               # Build controller binary (~2 minutes)
make gator                 # Build CLI tool (~1 minute)
make lint                  # Lint code using golangci-lint v2.3.0 (~1 minute)
make native-test          # Run unit tests natively (~4 minutes)
make test                 # Run tests in Docker (~5 minutes)
make test-e2e            # End-to-end tests with BATS (~10-15 minutes)
make docker-build         # Build Docker images
make deploy               # Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
```

**Critical Build Issues & Solutions:**
- **Empty test files cause lint failures** - remove any empty `.go` files in `pkg/` directories
- **Docker buildx required** - standard docker build will fail, must use buildx
- **Vendor dependencies** - run `go mod vendor` before building if vendor/ missing
- **Tool versions matter** - golangci-lint v2.3.0 specifically required

**Development Environment Setup:**
1. Install Go 1.24.2+ and Docker with buildx
2. Clone with full dependency chain: `git clone --recurse-submodules`
3. **Always run `go mod vendor` after fresh clone**
4. **Always run `make lint` before committing** - catches common issues
5. Use `make native-test` for fast feedback during development

### Testing Strategy

**Test Types & Commands:**
- **Unit Tests**: Go tests with testify/suite for component testing
  ```bash
  make native-test           # Fast, comprehensive unit testing (~4 minutes)
  make test                 # Run tests in Docker container (~5 minutes)
  ```
- **Integration Tests**: Kubernetes controller integration tests using envtest
- **E2E Tests**: Full cluster tests using BATS and Kind
  ```bash
  make test-e2e             # Requires kind cluster, tests real scenarios (~10-15 minutes)
  ```
- **Gator Tests**: Policy verification using gator CLI
  ```bash
  make test-gator           # Policy verification and CLI functionality
  ```
- **Performance Tests**: Webhook latency and throughput benchmarks
  ```bash
  make benchmark-test       # Generate performance metrics
  ```

**Testing Best Practices:**
- **Always run `make native-test` before submitting changes** - fast feedback cycle
- **Run `make test-e2e` for webhook/controller changes** - validates integration scenarios
- **Use `make test-gator` for policy/CLI changes** - ensures policy functionality works correctly

### Development Guidelines & Patterns

Make sure that there is a new line at the end of any file you edit. This is a common convention in Go and many other programming languages.

**CRD Development:**
1. **API Definitions** (`apis/` directory): Use controller-gen markers, follow Kubernetes conventions
2. **Controller Implementation** (`pkg/controller/` directory): Use controller-runtime patterns with reconciliation loops
3. **Webhook Implementation** (`pkg/webhook/` directory): Separate validation/mutation logic with structured logging

**Policy Development:**
- **Constraint Templates**: Define reusable policy templates with parameters
- **Constraints**: Instantiate templates with specific configuration
- **Rego/CEL Policies**: Write efficient policies with proper error handling (prefer CEL for performance)

**Code Standards:**
- Follow Go conventions with gofmt/goimports
- Use structured logging with logr interface
- Implement error wrapping and context propagation
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Follow controller patterns with proper cleanup using finalizers

### Security Considerations
**Security is paramount** - every component must be designed with security-first principles:

- **Critical**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs in admission webhooks
- **Mandatory**: Implement strict RBAC with principle of least privilege
- **Essential**: Use secure defaults for all configurations - never trust user input
- **Required**: Audit and log all policy decisions and violations for security monitoring
- **Must**: Ensure webhook certificates are properly managed and rotated
- **Always**: Assume hostile input and implement defense in depth
- **Never**: Expose sensitive data in logs, error messages, or responses

### Performance Guidelines
**Performance is critical** - admission controllers must be lightning fast to avoid blocking cluster operations:

- **Critical**: Minimize webhook latency (target <100ms p99, <50ms p95)
- **Mandatory**: Use efficient CEL over Rego for policy evaluation due to superior performance
- **Essential**: Implement proper caching for frequently accessed data
- **Required**: Monitor memory usage in long-running controllers
- **Must**: Optimize Kubernetes API calls with proper batching
- **Always**: Profile and benchmark code changes for performance impact
- **Never**: Trade performance for convenience - cluster stability depends on speed

### OPA Frameworks Integration
Gatekeeper heavily relies on the **OPA Frameworks/Constraint** library (`github.com/open-policy-agent/frameworks/constraint`) for core constraint and policy functionality:

- **Constraint Client**: Provides the core constraint evaluation engine that processes ConstraintTemplates and Constraints
- **Policy Drivers**: Supports both Rego and CEL policy engines through pluggable drivers
- **Template Management**: Handles ConstraintTemplate compilation, validation, and CRD generation
- **Review Processing**: Processes admission review requests against constraint policies
- **Error Handling**: Provides structured error reporting for policy violations and system errors
- **Instrumentation**: Built-in metrics and observability for constraint evaluation performance

**Key Integration Points:**
- `pkg/controller/constrainttemplate/`: Uses frameworks for template validation and CRD management
- `pkg/webhook/admission/`: Leverages constraint client for policy evaluation during admission
- `pkg/audit/`: Uses frameworks for periodic compliance checking of existing resources
- `pkg/drivers/`: Integrates with frameworks' policy engine drivers (Rego/CEL)

### Cert-Controller Integration
Gatekeeper uses **cert-controller** (`github.com/open-policy-agent/cert-controller`) for automatic TLS certificate management:

- **Certificate Rotation**: Automatically generates and rotates TLS certificates for webhook endpoints
- **CA Management**: Creates and maintains Certificate Authority for webhook validation
- **Secret Management**: Manages Kubernetes secrets containing TLS certificates and keys
- **Webhook Configuration**: Automatically updates webhook configurations with current CA bundles
- **Readiness Integration**: Provides readiness checks to ensure certificates are valid before serving

**Key Integration Points:**
- `main.go`: Sets up CertRotator with webhook configuration and certificate settings
- `pkg/webhook/policy.go`: Uses rotator for validating admission webhook TLS
- `pkg/webhook/mutation.go`: Uses rotator for mutating admission webhook TLS

### Common Patterns
- Use `context.Context` for all long-running operations
- Implement graceful shutdown handling
- Use proper Kubernetes owner references for resource relationships
- Follow the controller pattern with reconciliation loops
- Implement proper cleanup using finalizers when needed

### Communication Guidelines
When contributing to Gatekeeper, maintain clear and human-friendly communication:

**Code & Documentation:**
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful variable and function names
- Keep comments concise but informative - explain "why" not just "what"
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the intent behind changes
- Structure PR descriptions with context, changes made, and testing approach

**Error Messages:**
- Provide actionable error messages that guide users toward solutions
- Include relevant context (resource names, namespaces, constraint violations)
- Use plain language that both developers and operators can understand
- Suggest next steps or point to documentation when appropriate

**Policy Violations:**
- Write violation messages that clearly explain what was violated and why
- Include specific examples of compliant configurations when possible
- Keep messages concise but comprehensive enough for troubleshooting
- Use consistent terminology aligned with Kubernetes and OPA conventions

**Response Style:**
- Be direct and helpful without being overly verbose
- Focus on practical solutions and actionable advice
- Prioritize clarity over technical jargon when communicating with users
- Maintain a collaborative and welcoming tone in all interactions

## CI/CD & Validation

**GitHub Actions Workflows:**
- **`workflow.yaml`** - Main CI pipeline, tests across Kubernetes 1.31-1.33
- **`unit-test.yaml`** - Dedicated unit test execution
- **`lint.yaml`** - Code quality and formatting checks
- **All workflows must pass** before merge approval

**Pre-commit Validation:**
1. **Always run `make lint`** - catches formatting, imports, and style issues
2. **Always run `make native-test`** - ensures unit tests pass
3. **Run `make test-e2e` for webhook/controller changes** - validates integration
4. **Check `make manager && make gator`** - ensures binaries build correctly

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Unit tests must complete in <5 minutes** on standard hardware
- **Webhook latency must stay <100ms p99** - benchmark with `make benchmark-test`
- **Memory usage must be monitored** for long-running controllers

**Common Validation Failures:**
- **Lint failures:** Usually formatting or import issues, run `make lint` locally first
- **Test timeouts:** E2E tests can timeout after 15 minutes, check cluster resources
- **Build failures:** Often vendor/ or Docker buildx issues, ensure prerequisites met

**Security & Performance Notes:**
- **All admission webhook changes require security review** - validate input sanitization
- **Policy evaluation performance is critical** - prefer CEL over Rego for performance
- **Certificate rotation must work correctly** - test webhook TLS functionality
- **Never expose sensitive data in logs** - review log statements carefully
